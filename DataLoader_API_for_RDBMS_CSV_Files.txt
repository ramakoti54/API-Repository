            API Documentation described in this section demonstrates the main purpose of API Repository for distinct API protocols designed to perform tasks related to Data Loading, Machine Learning Simulation Automation capabilities for running same model with multiple optimization proceses and Automation functionalities of Ticker predictions.
The following detials about such API processes gives individual functional aspects. Loading data from CSV files or Databases to Data frames would help in transforming stock ticker file information to column format aides the developers to process the stock ticker related numericals through an analytical and statistical processer for performing distributions. Since, these distributions select from Advanced concepts of Statistical Analysis based algorithms or Optimization techniques of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts suffice to enahance the importance of Integrations to automate freequent processes for certain tasks to be repeated in the production deployable environments. The key idea of the API Repository illustrated through an example in this section majorly concentrate on downloading data from a Financial website to acquire required flat file with Stock ticker data and using the file to load into CSV files or RDBMS(SQL Server/Oracle DB is inclusive).

      There had been three major tasks associated to demonstrate the capabilities of API Integration facilities for Machine Learning and Ticker functionalities for the website include 
1. Data Loader to Data Frame from RDBMS/CSV files. 
2. Automation of Machine Learning and Data Science Model preparation from the Raw Data sources.
3. Machine Learning Simulation Automation tasks (includes Diverging Training, Testing inferences on datasets, Optimizaiton builders, 
                                                 Feature engineering process executions etc...)
4. Performing Backpropagation post analysis of Confusion Matrix matrics.


Data Loader to Data frame from RDBMS/CSV Files:
==============================================
            Any website ingeneral runs on information from distinct news channels about the business of Organization and Stocks performance
of any Organization significantly relies on regular news about Ticker and the results of the Organization.

**************. Driver connection to improve exposure to load drivers for installation and configuration process. URL For Connecting through Drivers Install mssql-python package.

                pip install mssql-python;

                pip install python-dotenv;

                Setup environment variables for configuring SQL server Drivers in the SQL Server.

If the connection String is not enabled to load data into the system setup using the following instructions from mssql_python connect library.
