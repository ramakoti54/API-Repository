# API-Repository

**** API is defined to keep all major versions and changes in API functionalities related to Data loading process of distinct files and
     Database Objects to required Targets. *****
**** The functionality is defined through specific formated file name with functionality name followed by .md extension. For instance, if
     the Data load is performing a CSV file load to Data frame of Numpy in python the file name defined as 
     "CSV_to_Data_Frame.md"  ****
**** The file defined with such extension demonstrates the algorithemic process in understanding the coding process for DataLoader. ****
**** An other type of file used to demonstrate python code implementation for defining API is through file name with an usecase of the 
**** functional requirement. In this scenario the functional use case is to Implement Data Load Integration for performing CSV/Database
     object loading to Dataframe.   ****
****  Artificts included till date to demonstrate.   ****

      1. DataLoader_API_for_RDBMS_CSV_Files.md
      2. API_Implement_Data_Load.py
